# task-manager

A simple Vue3 task manager where you can Add, View, Edit and Delete tasks.

please note: there is a server.rar file to extract and get the server data files.

## What I Used

- Vue 3 - Vue CLI.
- bootstrap 5 - style.
- fontawesome - icons.
- npm - package manager.
- json server - backEnd server.
- axios - API call.
